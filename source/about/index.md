### <i class="fa fa-leaf fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> What else I can say about myself
Emmmmmm...How time flies! Without any sign, more than twenty years have passed. As looking back on the past, I can see a little innocent boy, even kind of foolish, walked on foot through the muddy countryroad all day long, rode bike from home to school day after day, and then caught the train home once a year. Those times accompanied by laughs and tear drops make the boy become the man who I am. I thank the happiness with my family and friends and I also appreciate the pain through all my life. Only the healing scars of wound can really make one remember and learn stuffs that he can never learn from books or anything else. So I never regret things that passed. I only look forward.

I was born into a normal wage-earners' family in central china. Without any speciality and competition certificate, I went to college only by college entrance examination(ranked about *1000th* in *one million* candidates)  in 2008. I majored in *Resources and Environment Science* at *Shanghai Jiao Tong University* and soon felt apathetic. After one year's struggling, I decided to change my subject to physics. I minored in Applied Physics and finally achieved two Bachelor degrees when graduated. After that, I applied for the postgraduate program at *Shanghai Jiao Tong University* to further my study. During my postgraduate career for master degree, I focused on the quantum optical phenomena of *Micro-Cavity Optomechanical System*. A few research results were accomplished there. After acquiring my master degree, I went to Tsinghua University to pursue my doctorate in *Electronics Science and Technology*.

The more I studied and experienced, the more I discovered about what I am really interested in and where I should belong from heart. Just like a fate that has been designed, my current research projects are *Quantum Simulation in Circuit Quantum Electro-Dynamics* and *Quantum Computation with Superconducting Quantum Circuits*, which combine Computer Science, Electronics and Quantum Physics. These subjects allows me to think further about how this world works and who we are, so I decide to treat them as my lifelong research topic. I admire people who persist in their initial determinations, however, as time goes by, I gradually realize that Life is not all about things we are chasing, and one can't be surveyed in only one aspect——everyone is multidimensional. So far, my attitude towards life can be briefly paraphrased by [Yang Wen-li](https://gineipaedia.com/wiki/Yang_Wen-li)'s tag "There are some things one can achieve, some things one can't."

I read books, but I didn't read much. My favourites are [Lu Yao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu_Yao)'s *Ordinary World* and [Yu Hua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Hua)'s *To Live*. I watch movies, such as *[千と千尋の神隠し](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away)*, *[Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A9lie)*, *[Forrest Gump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Gump)*, *[Les choristes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chorus_(2004_film))*,*[500 Days of Summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/500_Days_of_Summer)* and *[Secondhand Lions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondhand_Lions)*. Instead of going to cinema, I watch movies on my computer. For me, watching a movie is just like reading a book, which needs one hundred percent attention. In may spare time, I'd like to arrange some chords and melodic lines by guitar and piano. I like various kinds of songs. Things change, but music never goes out of style. Besides, I am also fond of badminton and riding.

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I've watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate. All those...moments will be lost in time, like tears...in rain. Time to die.........

I have read from someone's blog that photograph is the key of the beauty of typesetting, and one photograph can tell more than hundreds of words. So here is a picture shot in Tsinghua before. Guess what they were doing?!
