This is [*HtPsi*](http://wiki.htpsi.me/about/)'s personal wiki website.

Previously, I used OneNote to take notes. But as these notes grew sharply, It took more efforts to search for the information needed.

Just then, I found my own website, and I thought "Hey! why not rearrange these notes on the internet!".Using the "tags" and "categories", these notes can be placed in order. So I set up this website and hope you can find something useful here!
